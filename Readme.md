<h3> How Socket Works: </h3>

A socket is a communication endpoint that allows two processes to communicate over a network. Here's how it works:

1. **Server Setup**:
    - Creates a socket
    - Binds to a specific address and port
    - Listens for incoming connections

2. **Client Connection**:
    - Creates a socket
    - Connects to server's address and port

3. **Data Exchange**:
    - Both sides can send/receive data
    - Communication is bidirectional
    - Uses TCP/IP or UDP protocols

4. **Connection Close**:
    - Either side can terminate connection
    - Resources are freed
    - Socket is closed

This creates a reliable way for networked applications to communicate. </p>
